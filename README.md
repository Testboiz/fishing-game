My attempt to recreate the backend of LGH Fish Hunt minigame from [Second Life](secondlife.com) in [Express.Js](https://github.com/expressjs/express)

I am inspired of the metaverse video game named Second Life, about how the players play the game and earn ingame currency, called Linden Dollars (L$)

This repository is the recreation of the server side code of the [Linden Gold Hunters](goldtokens.net) game named [Fish Hunt](goldtokens.net/games/fish_hunt.php)

This is the game where players fish to get some great catches, One may get stuff ranging from the Fish

This backend API doesn't always has to be used only in Second Life though, This backend can be used in plenty of platforms like mobile games using HTTP requests.
